# Challenge Activity! Attack, Defend, Retreat
- This activity will use many different elements that you have learned
- Overview:
	- You're going to create a program that has basic point systems, incorporating random, lists, and if statements
	- We want to have a list that is randomly full of "Attack", "Defend", and "Retreat"
	- Attack is worth 5 points, Defend is worth 3 points, and Retreat is worth -6 points
	- At the end, we're going to add up all the points according to your list, and then see who has the highest score!

- Steps:
	- Step 1: Create something that will generate random numbers, 0 - 2
	- Step 2: Assign the value 0 to Attack, 1 to Defend, and 2 to Retreat
	- Step 3: Make a list that contains 100 elements, and each time that we add a member to the list, then it's not a number: it's one of the three different Strings that we mentioned
		- Test it: try printing out the first 10 values of the list
	- Step 4: Add up all the points you won, according to the scoring system above!
